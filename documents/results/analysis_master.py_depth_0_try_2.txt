Here is the Python doc for the `store_data` function:

```python
def store_data(
    master_data: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]],
    annuaire: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    faculties: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    schedule_dict: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]],
    db: MongoDB,
) -> None:
    """
    Store the data in the database.

    This function takes in four main data structures:
    - master_data: A dictionary containing course details.
    - annuaire: A list of annuaire data.
    - faculties: A list of faculties data.
    - schedule_dict: A dictionary containing schedule data.
    - db: A MongoDB object for database connection.

    The function first drops the existing data in the database and then inserts the new data.
    It differentiates between four collections in the database: "courses", "programs", "faculties", and "schedules".

    Args:
        master_data (Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]): Dictionary containing course details.
        annuaire (List[Dict[str, Any]]): List of annuaire data.
        faculties (List[Dict[str, Any]]): List of faculties data.
        schedule_dict (Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]): Dictionary containing schedule data.
        db (MongoDB): MongoDB object for database connection.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return any value.
    """
```

Note: The `Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]` and `List[Dict[str, Any]]` types are used to represent the data structures as per the Python type hinting convention. The `Any` type is used to represent the values in the dictionaries. 

This docstring explains the purpose and behavior of the `store_data` function, including its input parameters, what it does, and its return value (or lack thereof in this case). This should provide a clear and concise understanding of the function's functionality.
