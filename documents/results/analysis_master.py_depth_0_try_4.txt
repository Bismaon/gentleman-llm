Here is the classification of each function according to the provided schema and the `FUNCTION_TYPES_GUIDE` (in detail):

- `main` function is classified as `ExternalInteraction` because it performs communication with an external system (database) and produces/consumes data exchanged outside the program's in-memory context.
- `store_data` function is classified as `ExternalInteraction` because it performs communication with an external system (database) and produces/consumes data exchanged outside the program's in-memory context.
- `log_insertion_details` function is classified as `ExternalInteraction` because it typically involves writing to an external system such as a log file.
- `find_in_sorted_list` function is classified as `PureUtility` because it performs a deterministic operation based only on input parameters and does not depend on external state.
- `refactor_faculties` function is classified as `PureUtility` because it performs a deterministic operation based only on input parameters and does not depend on external state.
- `readImportLinks` function is classified as `ExternalInteraction` because it performs communication with an external system (directories) and produces/consumes data exchanged outside the program's in-memory context.

Each function is classified based on its broad conceptual role, and the classification is supported by a brief reasoning statement. The classification follows the `FUNCTION_TYPES_GUIDE` provided.
