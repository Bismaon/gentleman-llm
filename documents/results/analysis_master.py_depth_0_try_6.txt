Here are the function instances classified according to the `FUNCTION_TYPES_GUIDE`:

```yml
FUNCTION_INSTANCE_BEGIN
function_name: main
function_type: ExternalInteraction
parameters:
  - name: root
    type: str
  - name: import_links_directory
    type: str
  - name: schedule_raw_directory
    type: str
  - name: schedule_parsed_directory
    type: str
  - name: annuaire_raw_directory
    type: str
  - name: annuaire_parsed_directory
    type: str
  - name: repertoire_raw_directory
    type: str
  - name: repertoire_parsed_directory
    type: str
  - name: hierarchy_path
    type: str
  - name: debug
    type: bool
return_type: None
description: Main entry point of the script to parse the raw data and populate the database.
tags: [parser, data population, script entry]
reasoning: classified as ExternalInteraction because it performs communication with external systems (file directories, database) and produces/consumes data exchanged outside the program's in-memory context.
FUNCTION_INSTANCE_END

FUNCTION_INSTANCE_BEGIN
function_name: log_insertion_details
function_type: PureUtility
parameters:
  - name: schedule_diff
    type: set
  - name: annuaire_diff
    type: set
return_type: None
description: Log insertion details of courses.
tags: [logging, insertion details]
reasoning: classified as PureUtility because it has no dependency on object state and performs deterministic output based only on input parameters.
FUNCTION_INSTANCE_END

FUNCTION_INSTANCE_BEGIN
function_name: store_data
function_type: ExternalInteraction
parameters:
  - name: master_data
    type: dict
  - name: annuaire
    type: list
  - name: faculties
    type: list
  - name: db
    type: MongoDB
return_type: None
description: Store the data in the database.
tags: [database, data storage]
reasoning: classified as ExternalInteraction because it performs communication with an external system (database) and produces/consumes data exchanged outside the program's in-memory context.
FUNCTION_INSTANCE_END

FUNCTION_INSTANCE_BEGIN
function_name: refactor_faculties
function_type: PureUtility
parameters:
  - name: faculties
    type: list
  - name: annuaires
    type: dict
  - name: directories_tuples
    type: list
return_type: list
description: Refactor faculties by merging programs.
tags: [faculty merging, program refactoring]
reasoning: classified as PureUtility because it has no dependency on object state and performs deterministic output based only on input parameters.
FUNCTION_INSTANCE_END

FUNCTION_INSTANCE_BEGIN
function_name: readImportLinks
function_type: ExternalInteraction
parameters:
  - name: directories_tuples
    type: list
return_type: dict
description: Read import links from directories.
tags: [import links, directory reading]
reasoning: classified as ExternalInteraction because it performs communication with external systems (file directories) and produces/consumes data exchanged outside the program's in-memory context.
FUNCTION_INSTANCE_END

FUNCTION_INSTANCE_BEGIN
function_name: find_in_sorted_list
function_type: PureUtility
parameters:
  - name: elem
    type: str
  - name: sorted_list
    type: list
return_type: int
description: Locate the leftmost value exactly equal to x in a sorted list.
tags: [list search, sorted list]
reasoning: classified as PureUtility because it has no dependency on object state and performs deterministic output based only on input parameters.
FUNCTION_INSTANCE_END
